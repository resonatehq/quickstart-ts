# Quickstart ‚Ä¢ Step 3 üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è

Boost your application's **scalability** by deploying Resonate Workers, enabling fan out and fan in to mitigate demand.

## Installation & Running the Application

#### Installing the Application

Install the Resonate Server (see [Installation Instractions]() for installation options):

```
brew install
```

Clone the repository, navigate to the ./Step3 directory, and install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

#### Running the Application

To launch the Resonate Server, enter:

```bash
resonate serve
```

In a new terminal, to launch your application, enter:

```bash
npm start
```

In a new terminal, to launch your application, enter:

```bash
npm start-worker
```

## Understanding the Application

The application is the same as the application from Step 2, with one difference: We are not processing the summarization locally but remotely:

```typescript
export async function downloadAndSummarize(context: Context, url: string) {

    // Summarize the content on a node with a gpu
    let summary = await context.run(`/gpu/summarize/summarize-${url}`, url);

    // Return the summary of the content
    return summary;
}
```

The resonate server is configured to forward any Durable Promise with a matching Promise Identifier (pid) to a task queue, here an http endpoint: 

```yaml
aio:
  subsystems:
    queuing:
      config:
        connections:
          - kind: http
            name: summarize
            pattern: /gpu/summarize/*
            metadata:
              properties:
                url: http://localhost:5001
```

The files `worker.ts` and `worker.py` illustrate how to develop a Resonate Worker listening on a http task queue from scratch.

#### Experiment with the Application

On request, the app creates a Durable Promise and waits for the remote execution to finish. 

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/summarize -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"url": "http://example.com"}'
```

The Resoante SDK connects to the Resonate Server to track the state of an execution, or more accurately the state of the promises representing an execution. You can inspect the state via the Resonate CLI.

```bash
resonate promise get summarize-http://example.com
```


The worker logs processing the task:

``` bash
Task received
Claiming task /gpu/summarize/summarize-http://example.com
Task claimed /gpu/summarize/summarize-http://example.com
Completing task /gpu/summarize/summarize-http://example.com
Completed task /gpu/summarize/summarize-http://example.com
```
